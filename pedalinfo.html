        A guitar pedalboard is a flat board or panel that serves as a container, patch bay, and power supply for effects pedals for the electric guitar. Some pedalboards contain their own transformer and power cables to power multiple pedals. Pedalboards help the player manage multiple pedals. The entire pedalboard can be packed up and transported to the next location without disassembly.
        Pedalboards often have a cover that protects the effects pedals during transportation. There are many varieties of pedalboard cases, including homemade do it yourself pedalboard cases, store-bought pedalboard cases, and custom-made pedalboard cases. Hard shell pedalboard-cases have foam padding, reinforced corners, and locking latches. During performance, with the lid
        removed, the bottom of the case is a pedalboard. Most pedalboards have a flat surface where pedals and their power supplies attach using hook-and-loop fasteners or other techniques, and often have a removable lid or padding to protect the pedals when not in use. Some pedalboards have handles or wheels to facilitate transportation.
